## Overview

It was an interesting practice! I'm happy that I was able to finish in one afternoon. Sizing is still challenging - if you have any tips to improve, I'd really appreciate that!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 3 and custom properties
- JavaScript
- [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Mainly for responsivity, but also some styling.

### What I learned

It was challenging to do the dynamic bars and day names, but especially the value displayed on top on the hover. Sizing is still quite a challenge, and I never seem to get it perfectly right.

### Continued development

I want to learn how to do sizing better.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - My go-to reference for most things.
- [W3 Scools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_display_element_hover.asp) - This page helped me with the onhover display of the values.
